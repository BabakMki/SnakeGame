The submitted version  of the snake game gives the possibility of two players. two snakes created on the screen which could fight for the food and they would die if they pass themselves.
snakes could also eat each other. if they are the same size none of them can eat the other one, but if a large snake and a small sake collide small snake dies and large snake grows by the size of the small snake.
